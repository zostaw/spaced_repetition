# spaced_repetition
Spaced Repetition - program with DB storing data to be withdrawn from and then placed in sequence over boxes in order to learn facts or quotes.

Principles of memorization:
I. To remember learned material over time, the learned material must be repeated according to forgetting curve
II. To be able to recall in other setting than the learning setup (computer + keyboard), the learning process must be engaging. It must:
    - use speech to connect the material with language and speech system; 
    - use visualization in mind, to connect the material with imagination and recall system;
    - use creative mind and real life examples to connect the material with the identity of a person who speaks, with the action and not only a skill of memorization.

The next steps:
1. add voice to the program: reading questions and listening to answers
    -correction for misspelled words, skip option
2. add GUI: either javascript in browser or html5
3. add pictures web search
